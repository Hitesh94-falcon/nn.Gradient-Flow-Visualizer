# Neural Networks Gradient Workflow Web App

Welcome! This repository contains a web app designed to help beginners understand the basic concepts of neural networks, especially the gradient workflow.

## Motivation

During my own journey in learning neural networks, I found it challenging to grasp how gradients actually work. To make this learning curve easier for others, I built this app to provide a clear and interactive introduction to these foundational ideas.

## Inspiration

The script and approach are inspired by Andrew Karpathy, a leading figure in the field of machine learning. His educational resources have greatly influenced the design and functionality of this app.

## Features

- Visual explanation of gradient computation
- Step by step workflow for neural networks
- Beginner friendly interface

## Roadmap

This is the first version of the app. Future versions will introduce additional functionalities, including:
- Loss function visualization and explanation
- Support for different activation functions
- Interactive parameter tuning
- Model evaluation metrics
- Expanded neural network architectures

Stay tuned for more updates and features!
